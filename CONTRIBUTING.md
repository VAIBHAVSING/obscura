# Contributing to Obscura

Thanks for your interest in Obscura. This guide covers how to build, test, and
submit changes. For the deeper, non-obvious engine details (architecture,
gotchas, robustness invariants), read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first; this file
does not repeat it.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We want Obscura to be a welcoming project, so
keep discussion focused on the work and assume good faith. Harassment or abuse
is not tolerated.

## Before you start

For anything beyond a minor documentation fix, **please open an issue first** (or
comment on an existing one) and say you intend to work on it. This lets us give
early feedback and avoids two people building the same thing or a PR that does
not fit the project's direction.

A few notes to keep the project maintainable:

- **Link an issue.** PRs without a linked issue or prior discussion may be
  closed, except for small doc fixes.
- **Human oversight required.** AI-assisted contributions are fine, but
  low-quality or unreviewed agent output will be closed. Understand and test
  what you submit.
- New to the codebase? Look for issues labeled `good first issue`.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release --workspace --exclude obscura-wasm --features render
```

- The first build compiles V8 from source: roughly 5 minutes and a few GB of
  disk. Incremental builds are seconds.
- Iterating on one crate? Scope it: `cargo build -p <crate>`.
- **Stealth** (`--features render,stealth`) retains rendering and adds the
  wreq/BoringSSL transport, browser-identity protections, and tracker blocklist.
  BoringSSL builds through CMake, so `cmake` must be installed. The rendering
  build uses rustls and needs neither CMake nor OpenSSL.
- If the vendored OpenSSL build hits an AVX-512 assembler error on your host,
  build with `OPENSSL_NO_VENDOR=1`.

## Testing

Run tests with **`cargo nextest`, not `cargo test`**:

```bash
cargo nextest run --release --features render -p <crate>
cargo nextest run --release --features render --no-fail-fast
```

`cargo test` runs the whole test binary in one process, but the engine holds a
single V8 isolate per process, so the runtime tests fail under it. `nextest`
runs each test in its own process, which is the only supported way.

The companion [`obscura-benchmark`](https://github.com/h4ckf0r0day/obscura-benchmark)
repository contains the broader behavioral and performance suites.

## Before you open a PR

For any code change:

1. `cargo nextest run --release --features render` passes for the crates you touched.
2. The full render-feature nextest command above passes.
3. `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 cargo build --release --workspace --exclude obscura-wasm --features render` compiles clean.
4. The companion benchmark remains green.
5. **Performance is a hard constraint.** Obscura is roughly 12x faster and uses
   about 6x less memory than headless Chrome on framework pages. Keep native
   Rust fast paths and add a JS fallback only for real spec edge cases. If your
   change could affect performance, benchmark old and new revisions interleaved
   with identical release builds, fixtures, networks, viewport, settle policy,
   and capture path. Report a distribution and memory use; the noise floor is
   about plus or minus 10%.
6. For rendering changes, run the deterministic `render-repros` fixtures and
   the representative real-site suite at both the top and bottom of pages.
   Confirm resource and navigation success before interpreting image diffs;
   pixel error is a tripwire, not a verdict. Never add hostname-specific layout
   or style behavior.
7. For stealth changes, re-test the relevant Rust feature path. A render-only
   build does not exercise the `wreq` path.

Keep ops panic-safe: a panic in an op must degrade to a null result, never
unwind into V8's FFI frame. Do not remove the robustness guards described in
AGENTS.md, including the V8 watchdog and the `tree.rs` reparenting guards.

Do not bulk-run `cargo fmt`. The tree is not rustfmt-clean, so a blanket format
produces a large unrelated diff. Match the surrounding style in the files you
edit. Comments should explain non-obvious "why", not restate the code.

## Commit messages

Keep them short and factual: what changed and why. We use a lightweight
`type(scope): summary` style, matching the existing history:

```
fix(cdp): honor text selection on Backspace and typing

Backspace trimmed the last character and typing always appended, ignoring
any selection. Both now respect a non-collapsed selection.

Fixes #316.
```

- `type` is one of `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `chore`. The `scope`
  is optional and lowercase (for example `cdp`, `js`, `net`, or `stealth`).
- No em dashes. Use commas, periods, or restructure the sentence.
- No AI-generated filler ("This commit improves...", "As an AI...").
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` lines or list yourself as a co-author.

## Pull requests

- All submissions are reviewed; a maintainer merges after approval.
- Keep the diff small and readable. One logical change per PR. Split large
  contributions into several PRs.
- Reference the issue the PR closes, and say how you verified it (the test or
  repro that now passes).

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with enough detail to reproduce:

- The obscura version or commit, plus OS and architecture.
- A repro: a URL, an `--eval` snippet, or a short CDP sequence.
- What you expected and what actually happened.
- If it is a rendering or compatibility issue, whether headless Chrome behaves
  the same. Anti-bot, CAPTCHA, and login walls block headless Chrome too from a
  datacenter IP, so those are not engine bugs.

Multi-statement `--eval` that starts with `const` returns `null` (V8 gives
`const` an empty completion value). Wrap repro snippets in an IIFE:
`(function(){ ...; return result; })()`.

**Security issues:** do not open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
for private reporting.

## Scope and direction

Obscura targets web scraping and AI-agent automation, and is heading toward a
hosted cloud scraping service. The priorities are real-world render success and
robustness (no crashes or hangs). Conformance and new Web APIs are welcome when
they do not regress performance or stability.

The stealth features are privacy-first anti-fingerprinting: they present a
normal, consistent browser identity so ordinary automation is not singled out.
Contributions that add detection-evasion for abusive purposes are out of scope.
